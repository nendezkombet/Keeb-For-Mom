KFM BUILD STEP :

Note : 
// Using solder flux very recomended !!!
// Prepare solder sucker if you make mistake
// Clip the leg of the component if it's to long
// Don't skip the build step

1. Solder capacitor (optional)
2. Solder RGB leds (optional)
3. Solder resistor 220ohm/330ohm (see PCB legend)
4. Solder Buzzer (see PCB legend)
5. Solder arduino pin header ( just pin header, for arduino do it in the last step )
6. Attach top plates and PCB then install switchs in every corner of the PCB also two switch that located at the top of the MCU
7. Flip the board and the MCU pin header should be on the right side
8. Solder the switchs we installed in the sixth step, and douuble check all connection especialy two switches and diode that located at the top of the MCU
9. If everything looked right then place and solder flashed MCU 
10.Solder the bridge pad between PCB board 
11.Before we solder all switches, plug usb cable and short all switches connector if everything works just install and tiddy up every switches
13.Solder all switches
14.Assembly the plate and congrats you had new 40% keyboardl

DO NOT RUIN YOUR WORKS AND COMPONENT FOR ONE SMALL MISTAKE, SO BE CAREFUL !!!
