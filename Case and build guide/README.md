KFM build guide :


Note : 

- Using solder flux very recomended !!!
- Prepare solder sucker if you make mistake
- Clip the leg of the component if it's to long
- Don't skip the build step
- DO NOT RUIN YOUR WORKS AND COMPONENT FOR ONE SMALL MISTAKE, SO BE CAREFUL !!!

1. Gather all components needed
2. Place the diodes the PCB, you can place the deodes from top or bottom of the PCB but please pay attention for diodes direction
3. Double check if there any reverse direction, if seem ok then solder all diodes and clip excess legs with nail clip or whatever you have
4. Solder pin header for MCU/Promicro ( just pin header without MCU ) 
5. If you use RGB per key solder all capacitors, resistor RGB data line and go on with RGB leds, in this case i do not use RGB perkey so i skip this step
6. And if you use passive buzzer just solder the resistor data line and passive buzzer ( look PCB legend as reference )

7. Install the switches in every corner of the plate also two switches that located at the top of the MCU
8. Flip the plate and attach the PCB, the MCU pin header should be on the right side

9. Solder two switches that placed at the top of the MCU, check the switches alignment, if not properly seated just heating the solder hole and tidy up
10. Move to corner switches you placed before and solder them
11. Than solder the MCU, at this step you can not undo your works so make sure there no mistake you made before, i recomended double check one more time

12. This step we will solder the bridge pad between PCB board , first fill all the pad with tin lead let it cool down few second and solder the pad from center position between bridge pad

13. Before we solder all switches, plug usb cable and short all switches connector if everything works just install and tiddy up every switches
14. Solder all switches

15. Assembly the plate and congrats you had new 40% keyboard !!!
